The aim of this task is to get all the tests to pass. The test are written in PHPUnit and are located in the /tests directory. PHPUnit can be installed with Composer and run using the binary inside the vendor folder `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.

Events are shows, such as Matilda, Phantom of the Opera, and School of Rock. Instances are the times the event takes place. An event always has one of more instances. A venue is where the instance takes places. An instance can only take place at one venue, but an event with multiple instances can take place at many venues.

There is a index.php file in the views folder. This will be populated with data as a result of making the tests pass. This will be visible by visiting the root of this project in a browser, e.g substrakt-task.test if using Valet.

Only PHP is needed, no database connection is required. There is mock data in the data dir.

If you have any questions about this task please email stu@substrakt.com

Thanks.
